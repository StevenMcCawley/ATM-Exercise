# ATM-Exercise
A short exercise created with React to demonstrate simple components in action

Starter files provided the simple deposit functionality, which I improved upon by adding input validation (no negative numbers are allowed). I also added the Withdraw functionality, with similar input validation. Finally, using bootstrap, I made the webpage look appealing with soft colors and margins.
