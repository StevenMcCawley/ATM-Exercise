# ATM-Exercise
A short exercise created with React to demonstrate simple components in action

Changes/additions to the starter files:
- seperating custom styles into style.css instead of inside index.html
- input validation for deposit and withdraw functionality
- verification to insure withdraw would not result in a negative account balance
- visual improvement utilizing bootstrap
